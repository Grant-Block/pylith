# Suggested Exercises

1. Increase the contrast in the shear modulus across the fault. How does this affect the solution?
2. Create `.cfg` files to run Steps 2 and 3 with a Cubit mesh.
3. Change Step03 to include multiple ruptures at different time intervals, while still accounting for the accumulated slip deficit.
4. Change the distribution and number of fake GPS stations in Steps 4 and 5. How does this affect the inversion results?
5. Change the distribution of slip in Step 4. How does this affect the inversion results?
6. Create Cubit Journal files that build up the geometry from points and curves, analogous to the Gmsh Python script.
7. Create a Gmsh Python script that generates the geometry from a cross-section of a 3D block, analogous to the provided Cubit Journal files.
