# Suggested Exercises

1. Change the reference stress state in Step 2 by editing the spatial database. How does this affect the solution?
2. Create `.cfg` files to run the simulations with a Cubit mesh.
3. Create additional spatial database files so that the material properties for each material are different. Rerun Steps 2 and 3. How does this affec the solution?
4. Adjust the distribution of surface tractions in Step 4.
5. Experiment with different basis orders of 1 or 2 for the solution subfields. Examine both the displacement and stress fields (included in the output files for the materials). 
6. Adjust the timing of the earthquake ruptures in Steps 6-8.
7. Create Cubit Journal files that build up the geometry from points and curves, analogous to the Gmsh Python script.
8. Create a Gmsh Python script that generates the geometry from a cross-section of a 3D block, analogous to the provided Cubit Journal files.
