# Suggested Exercises

1. Change the elastic bulk rheology properties to be depth dependent.
2. Add spatial variation to the slip distribution in Step 2.
3. Change the distribution of aseismic slip (creep) in Steps 3 and 4.
4. Change the distribution of slow slip in Step 6 and the GPS stations used in Steps 6 and 7.
5. Optimize the depth variation of the initial stresses in Step 8a to minimize the deformation.
