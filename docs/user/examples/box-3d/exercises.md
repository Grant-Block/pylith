# Suggested Exercises

1. Adjust the material properties in Step 1 and verify the effect on the deformation and stress field.
2. Use the `tet.gmsh` file in any of the steps. Can you change the mesh file using one additional command line argument?
3. Use the Exodus files from Cubit rather than the files from Gmsh.
4. Change the boundary conditions in Steps 2-5 to generate a different shear strain.
5. Set the basis order and quadrature order to 2. Do you get the same solution? Why?
6. In Step 4 change the initial conditions so that only one of the components is equal to the solution?
7. In Step 5 adjust the rate or time when the rate dependence starts.
